## üí£ Troubleshooting

---
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **VR Swimming Feature Implementation Issue**

When implementing the swimming mechanic in VR, the initial approach involved applying force in the opposite direction of the controller's movement using **Unity's physics engine** and the `Rigidbody.AddForce()` function to simulate the swimming motion. However, this approach led to several challenges.

#### **Issues Encountered**
---

- **Inconsistent Movement**:  
  The movement between the controller's actions and the physical response was **not smooth**. Small controller movements resulted in exaggerated or erratic physical reactions, making the swimming motion feel unrealistic and irregular.

- **Input Sensitivity**:  
  The input from the controllers was highly **sensitive**. Even the slightest hand movement would produce an excessive physical response, making the swimming motion **unnaturally fast**. This led to an uncomfortable and unbalanced experience for the player.

---
### **Solution Approach**
---

To solve the issue, the focus shifted to **optimizing the interaction between input and physics** for a more stable and controlled swimming experience. Instead of relying solely on raw physics-based force application, the solution incorporated **InputActionReference** for more precise input tracking and adjustments to the swimming force.

---
### **Solution Steps**
---

1. **Improved Input Handling with InputActionReference**:  
   The **InputActionReference** class was used to **precisely track the controller's movement**. By using **Unity's Input System**, we captured the **velocity** of the left and right controllers in **real-time**. This allowed for **fine-tuned input control**, ensuring that the swimming response is more consistent with the controller's movements.
     ```csharp
     var leftHandVelocity = leftControllerVelocity.action.ReadValue<Vector3>();
     var rightHandVelocity = rightControllerVelocity.action.ReadValue<Vector3>();
     Vector3 localVelocity = leftHandVelocity + rightHandVelocity;
     localVelocity *= -1;
    ```
   This approach reads the controller velocity and combines the movements of both hands to calculate **local velocity**, applying the necessary force in the opposite direction to simulate swimming.

2. **Force Application Optimization**:  
   To prevent **overreaction** to small movements, the force application was optimized by ensuring that force is applied only when the calculated velocity exceeds a certain threshold, which is defined by `minForce`. This prevents **minor hand movements** from triggering exaggerated physical reactions.
    ```csharp
    if (localVelocity.sqrMagnitude > minForce * minForce) {
      Vector3 worldVelocity = trackingReference.TransformDirection(localVelocity);
      _rigidbody.AddForce(worldVelocity * swimForce, ForceMode.Acceleration);
    }
    ```
   This method ensures that the force applied to the swimmer is proportional to the magnitude of the movement, avoiding erratic behavior and creating a more **realistic and controlled swimming experience**.

3. **Drag Force for Natural Resistance**:  
   To simulate the **resistance of water** and slow down the swimmer when no active input is detected, a **drag force** was introduced. This drag force **gradually decelerates the swimmer**, helping to smooth out the swimming motion and make it feel more natural.
    ```csharp
    if (_rigidbody.velocity.sqrMagnitude > 0.01f) {
      _rigidbody.AddForce(-_rigidbody.velocity * dragForce, ForceMode.Acceleration);
    }
    ```
   This drag force acts in the opposite direction to the swimmer's velocity, providing friction-like behavior that reduces speed over time.

---
### **Conclusion**
---
By combining **InputActionReference** for more accurate input tracking and optimizing the force application with Unity's physics engine, the issue of **input sensitivity** and **inconsistent movement** was resolved. The final implementation now provides a **smooth and responsive swimming experience** in VR, with **natural resistance** modeled by drag force. This solution creates a more immersive and comfortable swimming mechanic for users.
